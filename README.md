# Rock-paper-scissor-mini-game

As simply design of Rock,Paper,Scissors game with actual svg, the reason behind was to test my skills if i am work on my own without the tutorials videos and other materials used, and to ensure that i am going to the right direction as I self-taught and continue with the journey.


-Problems encountered:
1. As self-taught, bugs wwere all over the code.
2. Very rusty with JavaScript so some of the functions are left out.
3. Javascript took me lot of hours to make it respond and function accordingly "Not showing all the results".

   -Solutions:
   1. Had help from ChatGPT to finish some of the code as i am a beginner.
   2. installed Vscode extension played a role when it comes to finding errors, spell-correction and debugging.

      
  + Upcoming features:
    1. well designed scoreboard for separated scores.
    2. player Vs player mode.
    3. 3 player mode.
